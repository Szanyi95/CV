    I am a hobbyist photographer, <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-szanyi-320a91188'>marketing professional</a> and web developer in training. I went to University at Manchester Metropolitan University from 2014-2018 and earned a diploma
    of higher education in Digital Media Marketing. After leaving University I acquired a job at the health-tech startup Howz as their marketing assistant and worked there for a total of 1 year before departing. I made the decision that I needed to
    develop my skills as a marketing professional in a more structured and cooperative environment. Since then I have taken a step back from marketing and am currently working through a Udemy course to train as a <b><i>full-stack</i></b> web
    developer, where I ultimately hope to assist an existing company with my acquired knowledge and skills; or take on clients by myself and build up a portfolio.
